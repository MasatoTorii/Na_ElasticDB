# Na_ElasticDB

This repository includes the database of elastic properites of various Na-ion conductors calculated using VASP (first-principles calculations). 

Specifically, ElasticDB_Na.csv includes the information about elastic moduli and other related information, and ELASTIC_TENSOR folder includes the elastic tensor files obtained directly by first-principles calculations.
